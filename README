These are my dotfiles.

Based around holman/dotfiles. Lots of vim stuff inspired by skwp/dotfiles.

# Setting up a new Mac

First, get the Xcode command line tools from [https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action#](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action#), or just install Xcode and install it from there.

Next, install homebrew:

`ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"`

Done. Clone these dotfiles and run `install.sh`
