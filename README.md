# .files

These are my dotfiles.

I use [rcm](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/rcm-for-rc-files-in-dotfiles-repos) and you should too.

There is a `mac` script which will set up your environment and keep things up to date.

# Setting up a new Mac

- Install Xcode from App Store
- `xcode-select --install`
- `git clone https://github.com/tamagokun/dotfiles.git`
- `cd dotfiles && mac`

Run `mac` at any time to keep packages up to date.
